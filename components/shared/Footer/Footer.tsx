            configuration of your eligible trade-in device. Not all devices are
            eligible for credit. You must be at least 18 years old to be
            eligible to trade in for credit or for an Apple Gift Card. Trade-in

            purchase. In-store trade-in requires presentation of a valid photo
            ID (local law may require saving this information). Offer may not be
            available in all stores, and may vary between in-store and online

            trade-in partners reserve the right to refuse or limit quantity of
            any trade-in transaction for any reason. More details are available
            from Appleâ€™s trade-in partner for trade-in and recycling of eligible
            devices. Restrictions and limitations may apply.{" "}
